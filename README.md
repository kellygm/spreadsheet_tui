# Grid Kid - Spreadsheet Program
This semester-long project is a terminal user interface of a spreadsheet. Like other spreadsheet programs, this one presents a table of cells that the user fills with data and formulae to achieve various computational tasks. Users will enter into cells either code or plain text data. The code may contain cell references, variable references, multiple statements.

This project was broken down into various subprojects.
<ul>
<li>Lexer</li>
<li>Parser</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
</ul>

** I am currently still expanding on this project so that it supports the following:**
- conditionals
- loops
- function calls
